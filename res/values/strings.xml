    <string name="home_note">Still apt are these lines by Sir Samuel Garth (1661 – 1719), English physician and poet, revealing the obvious shortcomings of medical knowledge and those seeking to use it. Despite there being several areas beyond our understanding, we can still valiantly, albeit naively, try and catch up with the unknown rather than letting it get too far ahead.\n\nSearching and researching the annals of medicine and learning by experience with a touch of imaginative brilliance alongside can go a long way in unraveling the medical mysteries.\n\nWhat better way to do it than with fellow students and future professionals in one of the more well-known medical institutes in the country!\n</string>

    <string name="te1">“I love argument, I love debate. I don’t expect anyone just to sit there and agree with me, that’s not their job.”\n\n~ Margaret Thatcher\n\n\nThey say it is better to debate a question without settling it than to settle a question without debating it. The world of medicine has only grown with dissent, disputes and debates. We have come a long way from the original meaning of the word debate, ‘to fight’; the fight is now more intellectual than physical. Those of you with verbal mastery, flawless logic and a knack of persuasion, now move over your Facebook debates, Twitter wars and armchair activism.
